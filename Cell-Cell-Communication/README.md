# Cell-cell communication

A couple of examples are shown here by using CellChat:https://github.com/sqjin/CellChat

For running the notebooks, the following Docker Image can be used: https://github.com/earmingol/singlecell-ccc

- [First, preprocess the PBMC-3k dataset with Seurat](Seurat-Tutorial.ipynb)
- [Then, run CellChat in this single dataset to identify CCC](CellChat-SingleDataset.ipynb)
- [Multiple conditions can be compared in a tumor-based dataset](CellChat-MultipleDatasets.ipynb)
